# TouchFlow #

TouchFlow is a visual editor that allows to model the flow of input data from mouse, fingers or other devices, using transformations, to the output media like 2D or 3D graphics. It is particularly suited for controlling continuous movement. It is similar to tools like [Max/MSP](http://cycling74.com/) and [vvvv](http://vvvv.org/) but explicitly geared toward processing multitouch inputs. TouchFlow is fully implemented in Java.

Recently, TouchFlow has been extended to connect to a Kinect device.

TouchFlow was developed at the [Embodied Agents Research Group](http://embots.dfki.de) (EMBOTS) at [DFKI](http://www.dfki.de), Saarbrücken. Frederic Raber developed the system for his Bachelor project at Saarland University, based on concepts by Frederic Raber and [Michael Kipp](http://www.dfki.de/~kipp).

## Getting Started ##

You first need to install Java3D (current version is 1.5.1): [Java3D 1.5.1 download page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-java-client-419417.html#java3d-1.5.1-oth-JPR)

The source code is organized as a Netbeans project so the easiest way to try it is to [download/install Netbeans](http://netbeans.org/downloads/) and select "open project" and then the directory you put the code in. However, you can also look at the build file (Ant) to compile it without Netbeans.
